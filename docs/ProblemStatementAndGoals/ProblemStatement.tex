\section{Problem Statement}

\wss{You should check your problem statement with the

\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required
information.}

\subsection{Problem}

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

\section{Goals}
\subsection{High Data Accuracy}
\textbf{Description: }The system should have high classification accuracy for objects reported in the images. \\\\
\textbf{Rationale: }The core problem this system must solve is extracting useful information from the provided images.
 One key metric to determine the utility of the information found, is the classification accuracy of objects identified in the images. If the system is 
 not able to determine what is contained in an image, it will not be useful to stakeholders.
\subsection{Ease of use}
\textbf{Description: }The system should be very easy for stakeholders to use. There should be very low friction for users to classify images and objects found
within images, with minimal training. It should also be simple for users to upload images to be analyzed.\\\\
\textbf{Rationale: }To maximize the information gained from users who are contributing to classification efforts, the system must ensure it is simple for users to 
get started with, and continue using the system. This is necessary to build a large enough user base, which will make it more likely to get insights in an acceptable 
amount of time.
\subsection{Minimizing Cost to Analyze Images}
\textbf{Description: }The system should minimize the cost for users who upload images. This could be implemented through intelligent algorithms for task delegation. \\\\
\textbf{Rationale: }Users of the system are interested in getting an appropriate return for their investment. If the cost to analyze is too high, the platform will not
retain a sufficiently large user base of purchasers.
\subsection{Results Returned Within Appropriate Timeframe}
\textbf{Description: }The system should ensure the time it takes to obtain information from images is within a specified limit. \\\\
\textbf{Rationale: }Purchasers will have some time limit they require the system to process images within. To ensure timing needs are met, the system should provide realistic timelines and stick to them.
\subsection{High System Reliability and Accessibility}
\textbf{Description: }The system should be useable remotely for purchasers and labellers, and have minimal downtime. \\\\
\textbf{Rationale: }The system should allow purchasers to upload images without being physically located where the system is hosted to ensure flexibility. The same should also be true for labellers, as they 
should be able to perform their tasks at home. In both cases, the system should have low down time as to not introduce additional friction into the completion of tasks.

\section{Stretch Goals}
\subsection{Automatic Data Labelling}
\textbf{Description: }The system should be able to use our extensive data set to automatically label new images. \\\\
\textbf{Rationale: }The introduction of automatic data labelling will improve the speed and reduce the cost to label images. This will allow the system to provide more value to 
purchasers, and allow the labellers to focus on harder to label images.
\subsection{Multi-Source Integration}
\textbf{Description: }The system should combine additional geo-spatial datasets, such as weather or census data, to obtain additional information from satelite imagery. \\\\
\textbf{Rationale: }Additional data sources will improve the value of data collected for purchasers. This is especially true for those interested in predicting future trends from the 
data found in their satelite images.



\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State your expected challenge level (advanced, general or basic).  The
challenge can come through the required domain knowledge, the implementation or
something else.  Usually the greater the novelty of a project the greater its
challenge level.  You should include your rationale for the selected level.
Approval of the level will be part of the discussion with the instructor for
approving the project.  The challenge level, with the approval (or request) of
the instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\wss{Teams may wish to include extras as either potential bonus grades, or to
make up for a less advanced challenge level.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Normally the maximum number of extras will be
two.  Approval of the extras will be part of the discussion with the instructor
for approving the project.  The extras, with the approval (or request) of the
instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
