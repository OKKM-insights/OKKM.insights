Kyle's commits are inflated by his work on setting up CD/CI for building latex documents. To get it working, he made 74 commits to main to test building a new PDF document. With these commits removed, this is the new table:\\

The number of issues assigned to Kartik might look less but this was because he took up other responsibilites one being doing the reflections for the documents.\\
