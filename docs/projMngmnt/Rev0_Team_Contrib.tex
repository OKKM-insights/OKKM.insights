\maketitle

This document summarizes the contributions of each team member up to the Rev0
Demo. The time period of interest is the time between the POC demo
and the Rev0 demo. Specifically, we will be reviewing the period from November 25th until January 29th. For each metric, we will include a table for the period of interest, as well as the entire term. Our work is split over 4 repositories, so when relevant we will specify
where contributions have been made.

\section{Demo Plans}



We will be demonstrating the MVP of OrbitWatch, a crowdsourced data labelling platform.

\section{Team Meeting Attendance}

% \wss{For each team member how many team meetings have they attended over the
% time period of interest.  This number should be determined from the meeting
% issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the table should be the total
% number of team meetings held by the team.}

Kartik was available for one of his missed meeting but there were some wifi issues in the thode building where our room was booked. Decided to go through meeting notes in the teams chat. \\

\section{Supervisor/Stakeholder Meeting Attendance}

% \wss{For each team member how many supervisor/stakeholder team meetings have
% they attended over the time period of interest.  This number should be determined
% from the supervisor meeting issues in the team's repo.  The first entry in the
% table should be the total number of supervisor and team meetings held by the
% team.  If there is no supervisor, there will usually be meetings with
% stakeholders (potential users) that can serve a similar purpose.}

Kartik let the team know well in advance about his different meeting (clash) and made sure the message was conveyed through one of the teammates. He let the TA know himself as well in the next tutorial meeting.

\section{Commits}

% \wss{For each team member how many commits to the main branch have been made
% over the time period of interest.  The total is the total number of commits for

% \wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.  For
% instance, if a team member has more commits to unmerged branches, these numbers
% can be provided here.  If multiple people contribute to a commit, git allows for
% multi-author commits.}
Oleg's commit count is low due to his preference for working in a word processor before transferring completed sections to LaTeX. Most assigned issues were completed in one go, with reviews conducted outside of GitHub's infrastructure. Additional commits result from review feedback or self-corrected typos.


% \wss{For each team member how many issues have they authored (including open and
% closed issues (O+C)) and how many have they been assigned (only counting closed
% issues (C only)) over the time period of interest.}

The number of issues assigned to Kartik might look less but this was because he took up other responsibilites, one being doing the reflections for the documents.\\
Kyle was the only team member to create and assign issues during the first deliverable. This was prior to completing our team git protocol, so other team members did not create issues and therefore Kyle has 8 additional issues created. Kyle also authors meeting issues.
