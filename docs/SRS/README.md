# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## Overview
The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is essential for defining the project requirements, both functional and non-functional, that the system must meet. This document serves as a foundation for the development team, stakeholders, and any collaborators, providing clarity on what the software will accomplish, who it serves, and the constraints under which it must operate.

The SRS covers detailed requirements across various areas, including:
- **Functional Requirements**: Specifies the primary operations the system must perform.
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Includes performance, usability, security, and other system qualities.
- **Stakeholders**: Lists key groups involved or impacted by the software, such as end-users, clients, and data labelers.
- **Constraints**: Defines limitations related to budget, schedule, technical compatibility, and regulatory considerations.
- **Assumptions**: Outlines assumptions that guide the development process, like user internet access and data availability.
  
This document ensures a shared understanding among all parties involved in the project, serving as a blueprint throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Folder Structure
The `srs` folder contains the following key files:

- **SRS.pdf**: The complete Software Requirements Specification document, compiled as a PDF for easy reference and readability. This document is designed to be comprehensive yet accessible, providing all necessary details about the software’s requirements.
  
- **SRS.tex**: The LaTeX source file for the SRS document. This file contains the structured code to generate the PDF, including formatting, sections, and content. Any updates or modifications to the SRS should be made in this file to ensure consistency and accuracy in future versions of the PDF.

## Key Sections in SRS.pdf
The SRS document is structured into several major sections:

1. **Purpose of the Project**: Details the business needs and objectives that the software will fulfill, outlining the primary goals and vision.

2. **Stakeholders**: Identifies key stakeholders, including end clients, data labelers, maintenance technicians, and other entities relying on the software.

3. **Functional Requirements**: Defines the core functionalities the system must support, such as user account management, image annotation, and data export capabilities.

4. **Non-Functional Requirements**: Covers critical quality aspects like usability, performance, scalability, security, and maintainability.

5. **Mandated Constraints**: Describes limitations and boundaries within which the software must operate, including hardware, software, and environmental factors.

6. **Relevant Facts and Assumptions**: Lists assumptions and facts that influence the software’s requirements and design, such as internet access, data availability, and anticipated user behavior.

7. **Glossary and Terminology**: Provides definitions for terms, acronyms, and technical jargon used throughout the document to ensure consistency and clarity.

Each section is structured to help stakeholders and developers understand the software’s expectations, requirements, and intended use. The SRS document is a living document and may evolve as the project progresses, adapting to new requirements or feedback.
