            \item \textbf{Rationale}: A practice environment enables users to build confidence and hone their skills in a low-pressure setting, ensuring they are prepared for real tasks.  
            \item \textbf{Fit Criterion}: At least 80\% of new users should utilize the practice environment, with self-assessment scores indicating an average improvement of 20\% in labeling accuracy over their first three attempts.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ongoing Support and Community Forum}  
        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2cm]
            \item \textbf{Description}: Provide ongoing support through a community forum or discussion board where users can ask questions, share experiences, and learn from one another.  
            \item \textbf{Rationale}: A support forum fosters a sense of community, provides peer-to-peer assistance, and reduces the load on formal support channels.  
            \item \textbf{Fit Criterion}: At least 75\% of user questions in the community forum should be answered by either other users or support staff within 2 days.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Periodic User Training Assessments}  
        \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2cm]
            \item \textbf{Description}: Conduct periodic assessments of user knowledge through quizzes or practical tasks to identify training gaps and offer refresher sessions where needed.  
            \item \textbf{Rationale}: Regular assessments help ensure users retain knowledge and stay up-to-date with platform changes, enhancing overall productivity and satisfaction.  
            \item \textbf{Fit Criterion}: At least 70\% of users should participate in training assessments, with scores indicating a consistent understanding of platform features and workflows.
        \end{itemize}

\section*{25 Ideas for Solution}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2cm]
    \item \textbf{AI-Driven Labeling System}: Implement a machine learning model for preliminary image analysis to assist human labelers. This AI system can automatically pre-label sections of satellite images, allowing human labelers to validate or adjust these labels, significantly speeding up the process.
    
    \item \textbf{Gamification for Crowdsourced Labeling}: Introduce a gamification element to motivate and engage users who are labeling data. This can include earning points, badges, or rewards for completing labeling tasks accurately and efficiently, which can improve data quality and increase participation.
    
    \item \textbf{Intelligent Task Allocation}: Utilize an algorithm that matches labeling tasks with users based on their experience, preferences, and performance history. This ensures that difficult tasks are assigned to more experienced users while simpler tasks are made available to beginners.
    
    \item \textbf{Real-Time Collaboration and Consensus Model}: Allow multiple labelers to work on the same image in parallel, using a consensus model to determine the most accurate labels. Incorporate a review mechanism to resolve discrepancies and ensure that the final labeled data meets the required quality standards.
    
    \item \textbf{Automated Quality Assurance (QA) and Feedback}: Develop a QA system that automatically checks the quality of labeled data by comparing it to known benchmarks or running cross-validation with multiple labelers. Provide labelers with instant feedback to help improve their accuracy over time.
    
    \item \textbf{Modular Web-Based Platform Architecture}: Build a modular architecture for the platform, separating the frontend, backend, and AI components. This will allow easy updates, scalability, and the ability to add new features or services without disrupting existing functionality.
    
    \item \textbf{Flexible API for Client and User Integration}: Create an API that allows clients to easily upload satellite imagery, retrieve labeled data, and interact with the system programmatically. Also, provide endpoints for labelers to claim tasks, submit work, and check their progress or earnings.
    
    \item \textbf{Visualization Dashboard for Data Insights}: Provide clients with a dynamic dashboard that visualizes key insights derived from the labeled satellite imagery. This dashboard can display analytics, progress on labeling tasks, model accuracy, and any actionable insights relevant to the client’s industry.
    
    \item \textbf{Secure Payment and Compensation System}: Implement a secure and transparent payment system that allows clients to pay for labeled data and compensates labelers based on their contributions. Use automated transaction management to ensure timely and accurate payments to all users.
    
    \item \textbf{Cross-Platform Compatibility and Accessibility}: Design the platform to be fully accessible across devices (desktop, mobile, tablets) and compliant with accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG). This ensures that a wide range of users, including those with disabilities, can participate in labeling and use the platform effectively.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member. --> TESTING
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice? --> TESTING
