\section{Purpose of the Project}
There is currently a lack of high-quality, labeled satellite imagery datasets tailored for specific use cases. Many industries require specialized data for tasks like disaster 
response, environmental monitoring, urban planning, or defense, but building these datasets manually is time-consuming, costly, inefficient and may require expert data analysis. 
This hinders the development and deployment of accurate computer vision models for critical use cases across these various industries.

The purpose of this project is to create an online platform that accelerates this process and brings simplicity to satellite imagery data analysis.
\subsection{Goals of the Project}
\subsubsection{High Data Accuracy}
The system should have high classification accuracy for objects reported in the images. The core problem this system must solve is extracting useful information from the provided images.
 One key metric to determine the utility of the information found, is the classification accuracy of objects identified in the images. If the system is 
 not able to determine what is contained in an image, it will not be useful to stakeholders.
\subsubsection{Ease of use}
The system should be very easy for stakeholders to use. There should be very low friction for users to classify images and objects found
within images, with minimal training. It should also be simple for users to upload images to be analyzed. To maximize the information gained from users who are contributing to classification efforts, the system must ensure it is simple for users to 
get started with, and continue using the system. This is necessary to build a large enough user base, which will make it more likely to get insights in an acceptable 
amount of time.
\subsubsection{Minimizing Cost to Analyze Images}
The system should minimize the cost for users request insights from images. This could be implemented through intelligent algorithms for task delegation. Users of the system who upload images are interested in getting an appropriate return for their investment. If the cost to analyze is too high, the platform will not
retain a sufficiently large user base of purchasers.
\subsubsection{Results Returned Within Appropriate Timeframe}
The system should ensure the time it takes to obtain information from images is within a specified limit, as determined by users who upload images. Purchasers will have some time limit they require the system to process images within. To ensure timing needs are met, the system should provide realistic timelines and stick to them.
\subsubsection{High System Reliability and Accessibility}
The system should be useable remotely for purchasers and labellers, and have minimal downtime.The system should allow purchasers to upload images without being physically located where the system is hosted to ensure flexibility of use. The same should also be true for labellers, as they 
should be able to perform their tasks remotely. In both cases, the system should have low down time as to not introduce additional friction into the completion of tasks.

\section{Mandated Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The solution must be fully compatible with the latest stable releases of Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari browsers.\\ \textbf{Rationale:} Users will interact with the web application through various modern web browsers, so ensuring cross-browser compatibility is essential for providing a consistent user experience. \\ \textbf{Fit Criteria:} The web application must display consistently, maintain full functionality, and support core features across all specified browsers without major visual or functional discrepancies. Testing should be conducted on each browser to validate compatibility.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}
There is no current environment in which our application must be implemented.
\subsection{Partner or Collaborative Applications}
There are no constraints regarding external applications that must be used alongside our product.
\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}
There is no required off-the-shelf software that must be used for our application.
\subsection{Anticipated Workplace Environment}
There is no particular location where users are required to work and use the product. As a web application, it can be accessed from most computers with an internet connection. We do not anticipate that the users' environment will physically constrain their ability to use the app in any way.
\subsection{Schedule Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The proof of concept for this project must be ready to demonstrate by \textbf{November 11, 2024}. Not meeting this deadline will result in uncertainty about overcoming major risks associated with the project.
  \item The first project demonstration must be ready by \textbf{February 3, 2025}. Missing this deadline will reduce the time available to make refinements based on feedback and findings.
  \item The final demonstration must be ready by \textbf{March 24, 2025}. Missing this milestone would prevent the project from being presented and result in a significant loss of marks.
\end{itemize}

\section{Open Issues}
\textbf{Task Assignment Algorithm: }To ensure labelers are engaged as they complete tasks and to obtain the highest quality of information possible, the system must implement an intelligent task allocation system. This system has not yet been determined.
\\\textbf{Label Consensus Algorithm: }Similarly, the algorithm for combining multiple user labels into one accurate label has not yet been determined. 
\\\textbf{Labeling Services Offered: }The system has determined several potential labeling services to be offered by the system, but has not confirmed with certainty what will be included. This will be determined after more research has been completed on the task assignment algorithm.

\section{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
\subsection{Ready-Made Products}
\textbf{Amazon Mechanical Turk: } A web-based crowdsourcing platform. Instead of building a novel front end, the system could obtain labels through this platform instead.
\subsection{Reusable Components}
\textbf{Label Studio: } A React library which contains components for building a web-based data annotation platform.
\subsection{Products That Can Be Copied}
\textbf{Tolka AI: } A general purpose image label crowdsourcing site. Supports image segmentation, bounding box drawing, and more computer vision labeling tasks.



\section{New Problems}
\subsection{Effects on the Current Environment}
The introduction of the OKKM Insights platform is expected to have several impacts on the existing technological and operational environment.
\subsubsection{Data Privacy and Security Concerns}
