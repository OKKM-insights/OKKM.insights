\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}
There is currently a lack of high-quality, labeled satellite imagery datasets tailored for specific use cases. Many industries require specialized data for tasks like disaster 
response, environmental monitoring, urban planning, or defense, but building these datasets manually is time-consuming, costly, inefficient and may require expert data analysis. 
This hinders the development and deployment of accurate computer vision models for critical use cases across these various industries.

The purpose of this project is to create an online platform that accelerates this process and brings simplicity to satellite imagery data analysis.
\subsection{Goals of the Project}
\subsubsection*{High Data Accuracy}
The system should have high classification accuracy for objects reported in the images. The core problem this system must solve is extracting useful information from the provided images.
 One key metric to determine the utility of the information found, is the classification accuracy of objects identified in the images. If the system is 
 not able to determine what is contained in an image, it will not be useful to stakeholders.
\subsubsection*{Ease of use}
The system should be very easy for stakeholders to use. There should be very low friction for users to classify images and objects found
within images, with minimal training. It should also be simple for users to upload images to be analyzed. To maximize the information gained from users who are contributing to classification efforts, the system must ensure it is simple for users to 
get started with, and continue using the system. This is necessary to build a large enough user base, which will make it more likely to get insights in an acceptable 
amount of time.
\subsubsection*{Minimizing Cost to Analyze Images}
The system should minimize the cost for users request insights from images. This could be implemented through intelligent algorithms for task delegation. Users of the system who upload images are interested in getting an appropriate return for their investment. If the cost to analyze is too high, the platform will not
retain a sufficiently large user base of purchasers.
\subsubsection*{Results Returned Within Appropriate Timeframe}
The system should ensure the time it takes to obtain information from images is within a specified limit, as determined by users who upload images. Purchasers will have some time limit they require the system to process images within. To ensure timing needs are met, the system should provide realistic timelines and stick to them.
\subsubsection*{High System Reliability and Accessibility}
The system should be useable remotely for purchasers and labellers, and have minimal downtime.The system should allow purchasers to upload images without being physically located where the system is hosted to ensure flexibility of use. The same should also be true for labellers, as they 
should be able to perform their tasks remotely. In both cases, the system should have low down time as to not introduce additional friction into the completion of tasks.

\subsection{Specifying a Business Use Case (BUC)}
To demonstrate the practical application and value proposition of the OKKM Insights platform, it is essential to define specific Business Use Cases (BUCs) that illustrate how different stakeholders will interact with and benefit from the platform.
\subsubsection{BUC Specification: Disaster Response Data Provisioning}
A government search and rescue agency receives a distress call reporting a downed airplane in a remote or inaccessible area. This report necessitates immediate action to locate the wreckage, assess the situation, and coordinate rescue operations. The OKKM Insights platform is notified of the incident through an integrated communication channel linked to the SAR agency’s reporting system. The platform automatically acquires the latest satellite images of the reported area from third-party providers and segments the large images into smaller, manageable tiles focused on the incident area. The algorithm then preprocesses and creates a task for data labelers using intelligent task delegation algorithms. Data labelers annotate critical features such as the airplane wreckage, debris fields, potential survivors, and any signs of environmental hazards. Consensus algorithms cross-verify annotations from multiple labelers, ensuring high accuracy and consistency. The platform then generates actionable insights, such as the precise location of the wreckage, extent of debris spread, accessibility of the area, and potential hazards. This data can then be used to train computer vision models using the newly labeled data to enhance the platform’s capability to automatically detect and classify aircraft and related features in satellite images. Finally the platform provides the SAR agency with access to the labeled dataset and the trained models through the platform’s user interface.

\textbf{Chosen Approach}

I, Kartik, will primarily pursue \textbf{online courses} to build a strong theoretical foundation in machine learning, supplemented by \textbf{practical projects} to reinforce my learning through application. This combination enables me to understand complex machine learning concepts and apply them effectively to the capstone project, ensuring the team leverages cutting-edge techniques for analyzing satellite imagery.

I, Kyle, am currently enrolled in Fundamentals of Machine Learning, Data-Driven Algorithms for Sequential Decision making, and Mathematical statistics. These courses will supplement the techniques Kartik described to help me learn the background knowledge required for the task allocation part of our project. I forsee that being the biggest challenge, but I am very excited to work on it. While taking these courses, I also have access to the professors, who will likely be willing to discuss issues we run into while designing our algorithms.

I, Mathew, will focus on completing \textbf{online courses} to get a better understanding of the basics of machine learning. Specifically, I plan to follow google's machine learning crash course. This is because it combines video lectures with interactive visuals and practice exercises, which I think is an effective way to quickly gain knowledge on a topic.
