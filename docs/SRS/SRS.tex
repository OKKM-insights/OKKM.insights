\section{Purpose of the Project}
There is currently a lack of high-quality, labeled satellite imagery datasets tailored for specific use cases. Many industries require specialized data for tasks like disaster 
response, environmental monitoring, urban planning, or defense, but building these datasets manually is time-consuming, costly, inefficient and may require expert data analysis. 
This hinders the development and deployment of accurate computer vision models for critical use cases across these various industries.

The purpose of this project is to create an online platform that accelerates this process and brings simplicity to satellite imagery data analysis.
\subsection{Goals of the Project}
\subsubsection{High Data Accuracy}
The system should have high classification accuracy for objects reported in the images. The core problem this system must solve is extracting useful information from the provided images.
 One key metric to determine the utility of the information found, is the classification accuracy of objects identified in the images. If the system is 
 not able to determine what is contained in an image, it will not be useful to stakeholders.
\subsubsection{Ease of use}
The system should be very easy for stakeholders to use. There should be very low friction for users to classify images and objects found
within images, with minimal training. It should also be simple for users to upload images to be analyzed. To maximize the information gained from users who are contributing to classification efforts, the system must ensure it is simple for users to 
get started with, and continue using the system. This is necessary to build a large enough user base, which will make it more likely to get insights in an acceptable 
amount of time.
\subsubsection{Minimizing Cost to Analyze Images}
The system should minimize the cost for users request insights from images. This could be implemented through intelligent algorithms for task delegation. Users of the system who upload images are interested in getting an appropriate return for their investment. If the cost to analyze is too high, the platform will not
retain a sufficiently large user base of purchasers.
\subsubsection{Results Returned Within Appropriate Timeframe}
The system should ensure the time it takes to obtain information from images is within a specified limit, as determined by users who upload images. Purchasers will have some time limit they require the system to process images within. To ensure timing needs are met, the system should provide realistic timelines and stick to them.
\subsubsection{High System Reliability and Accessibility}
The system should be useable remotely for purchasers and labellers, and have minimal downtime.The system should allow purchasers to upload images without being physically located where the system is hosted to ensure flexibility of use. The same should also be true for labellers, as they 
should be able to perform their tasks remotely. In both cases, the system should have low down time as to not introduce additional friction into the completion of tasks.

\section{Security Requirements}
\subsection{Access Requirements}
\subsubsection*{Requirement SR1:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Description:} The application shall only allow users with labeling access, including labellers, customers, and admins, to view active projects and label images.
  \item \textbf{Rationale:} We do not want random users with no stake in the process to effect the results.
  \item \textbf{Fit Criterion:} Users who have not logged in to the application have no way of viewing projects or labeling images. Users logged in as labellers, customers, or admins have access to these features.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Requirement SR2:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Description:} The application shall only allow users with customer access and above to create new image analysis projects.
  \item \textbf{Rationale:} Unidentified users creating projects would be impossible to facilitate. Also, labellers have no need to access project creation. 
  \item \textbf{Fit Criterion:} Users who have not logged in to the application have no way of creating an image analysis project. Users logged in as customers or admins have access to these features.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Requirement SR3:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Description:} The application shall validate the email format the user provides when creating an account.
  \item \textbf{Rationale:} We do not want users using invalid emails to sign up.
  \item \textbf{Fit Criterion:} Let E represent the set of all email addresses, and let V represent the set of all valid email addresses. A valid email address conforms to the general pattern:\\\\
  V = $(\forall\; email \in E\;  |\; email \; matches \; the \; pattern \; $[a-zA-Z0-9+\_.-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+[a-zA-Z])\\
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Requirement SR4:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Description:} The application shall validate the password format the user provides when creating an account.
  \item \textbf{Rationale:} We do not want users using weak passwords to sign up.
  \item \textbf{Fit Criterion:} Let P represent the set of all passwords, and let V represent the set of all valid passwords. A valid password has a at least one lowercase, uppercase, number and special character and is a minimum of 8 characters in length:\\\\
  V = $(\forall\; password \in P\;  |\; password \; matches \; the \; pattern \; $(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[\#\$\%\&\*\@])[a-zA-Z0-9\#\$\%\&\*\@]\{8,\})\\
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Integrity Requirements}
\subsubsection*{Requirement SR5:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Description:} The application shall prevent incorrect data from being introduced.
  \item \textbf{Rationale:} The database of information should always reflect correct and up to date information.
  \item \textbf{Fit Criterion:} The system must validate user inputs for data accuracy and format before they are saved. Any invalid data must trigger error messages, preventing it from being entered into the database. Users must be required to correct errors before proceeding.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Privacy Requirements}
\subsubsection*{Requirement SR6:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Description:} User data will be securely encrypted to protect user’s privacy.
  \item \textbf{Rationale:} This will help to avoid user's being compromised if a data leak occurs.
  \item \textbf{Fit Criterion:} An encryption algorithm is used on sensitive user data such as passwords.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Requirement SR7:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Description:} The application shall ensure that all payment transactions are processed securely using encryption and comply with relevant security standards, such as PCI-DSS, which helps to protect payment account data (PCI Security Standards Council, 2024).
  \item \textbf{Rationale:} Protecting users' financial information is critical to maintaining trust. Failing to secure payments can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and legal liabilities.
  \item \textbf{Fit Criterion:} All payment transactions must use industry-standard encryption to protect sensitive data. Payment information, such as credit card details, must not be stored locally on the application and must be processed via a secure, PCI-DSS-compliant third-party payment gateway.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Audit Requirements}
These requirements are not applicable as we are not an organization that is currently subject to audits.
\subsection{Immunity Requirements}
\subsubsection*{Requirement SR8:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Description:} The application shall use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions.
  \item \textbf{Rationale:} We want to prevent SQL injection attacks which can lead to unauthorized data access or manipulation.
  \item \textbf{Fit Criterion:} All database queries must be implemented using parameterized queries or prepared statements. Dynamic SQL strings that concatenate user input must not be used in the codebase.
