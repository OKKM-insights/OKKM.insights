    \item \textbf{Crowdsourcing and Compensation Model}: Users on the platform will label images and receive compensation, helping to ensure data quality while incentivizing participation.
    \item \textbf{Platform Accessibility}: The platform will be web-based, accessible through any modern browser on major operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS), enhancing its usability and portability.
    \item \textbf{Client Engagement}: The primary users include end clients who require labeled data and models, users who label data, and stakeholders like rescue services, financial data companies, and agricultural enterprises who benefit from the data insights.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{5.2 Business Rules}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2cm]
    \item \textbf{Data Privacy and Confidentiality}: No confidential information is currently protected, but IP may need protection in the future as the project evolves.
    \item \textbf{Apache License 2.0 Usage}: The project will use the Apache License 2.0, allowing others to use and modify the software freely, with payment required if used commercially.
    \item \textbf{Stakeholder Communication Protocols}: There will be established communication protocols, including weekly team meetings, regular updates, and documentation of all key communications with stakeholders.
    \item \textbf{Workflow and Git Management}: A structured Git workflow is in place, ensuring code quality through branching strategies, approvals, and consistent naming conventions. CI/CD practices include static checks, linting, and testing before code is merged.
    \item \textbf{Payment and Compensation}: Compensation rules are designed to reward users for labeling data accurately and efficiently, with a clear system in place for managing payments for both users and clients.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{5.3 Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2cm]
