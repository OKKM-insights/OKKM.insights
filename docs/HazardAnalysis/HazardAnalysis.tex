\section{Introduction}
Test Text

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\wss{You should say what \textbf{loss} could be incurred because of the
hazards.}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\wss{Dividing the system into components will help you brainstorm the hazards.
You shouldn't do a full design of the components, just get a feel for the major
ones.  For projects that involve hardware, the components will typically include
each individual piece of hardware.  If your software will have a database, or an
important library, these are also potential components.}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\subsubsection*{NFR-SE4}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Description:} The application shall prohibit new user actions when user is disconnected from the system.
  \item \textbf{Rationale:} The system should avoid batch updates upon reconnect as to prevent malicious users creating a false package of updates.
  \item \textbf{Fit Criterion:} Upon user disconnect and reconnect, the system will not accept any updates from the user not submitted before the disconnect occured.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{NFR-SE6}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Description:} The system shall, during system failure, notify users trying to make a request of the system failure.
  \item \textbf{Rationale:} The system should provide good warning messages to users to prevent additional frustration.
  \item \textbf{Fit Criterion:} When services are unavailable, the system shall provide an error message to the user making the request of the unavailable service.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{NFR-SE7}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Description:} The system shall reject duplicate entries in database.
  \item \textbf{Rationale:} Each entry to the database should be a unique data piece. If two entries are identical, they must differ by at least the creation time.
  \item \textbf{Fit Criterion:} No two entries in the database shall exist together for longer than 24 hours from their introduction into the database.
\end{itemize}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? sample text
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
