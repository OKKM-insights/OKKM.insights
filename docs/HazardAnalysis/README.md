# Hazard Analysis

## Overview
The Hazard Analysis document identifies potential risks and hazards that could impact the functionality, security, and reliability of the platform. This analysis helps the development team and stakeholders understand possible failure points and outlines mitigation strategies to reduce the likelihood or impact of these hazards. The document is particularly relevant for ensuring data integrity, security, and system performance in a complex, AI-powered crowdsourcing environment.

The primary objectives of the Hazard Analysis include:
- **Identifying Hazards**: Recognizing risks that could lead to system failures, data corruption, data leakage, or performance issues.
- **Analyzing Failure Modes**: Examining how potential failures in various components (e.g., Front End, Back End, Database, Machine Learning models) could impact the overall system.
- **Mitigating Risks**: Proposing mitigation strategies to prevent hazards or minimize their impact on the system and its users.

This document supports a safer and more reliable deployment by addressing the systemâ€™s vulnerabilities and laying out a plan for hazard management.

## Folder Structure
The `hazard_analysis` folder contains the following files:

- **HazardAnalysis.pdf**: The completed Hazard Analysis document in PDF format, which provides a thorough assessment of potential hazards and failure modes across different system components.
  
- **HazardAnalysis.tex**: The LaTeX source file for the Hazard Analysis document. This file includes the structured content and formatting used to generate the PDF. Any updates to the Hazard Analysis should be made here to ensure consistency in future versions.

## Key Sections in HazardAnalysis.pdf
The Hazard Analysis document is organized into several critical sections to address potential hazards within the OKKM Insights platform:

1. **Introduction**: Provides an overview of the purpose and scope of the Hazard Analysis, defining what constitutes a hazard in the context of the platform.

2. **Scope and Purpose**: Describes the importance of identifying and mitigating hazards to prevent loss and ensure the stability and security of the platform.

3. **System Boundaries and Components**:
   - **Front End (FE)**: Addresses potential hazards like user input errors, UI design flaws, and security risks (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting, session hijacking).
   - **Back End (BE)**: Focuses on risks in backend services such as login, payment processing, and task delegation, including potential hazards like authentication failures and task misallocation.
   - **Database (DB)**: Identifies risks of data corruption, SQL injection, and other vulnerabilities that could compromise data integrity.
   - **Machine Learning Task Allocation Model**: Discusses risks of misconfiguration, bias in task allocation, and adversarial attacks affecting the model.
   - **Libraries and Dependencies**: Covers risks associated with external libraries (e.g., BoTorch, TensorFlow, PyTorch) and dependency management.
   - **Python Processing**: Highlights performance bottlenecks, memory leaks, and security vulnerabilities in backend processing.
   - **Docker (Containerization)**: Explores container-specific risks like container breakout and resource exhaustion.

4. **Critical Assumptions**: Lists assumptions that guide the hazard analysis, such as the assumption that the database remains secure and network connectivity is stable.

5. **Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA)**: Breaks down potential failure modes, their effects on the system, causes, detection methods, and recommended mitigation actions. Each failure mode is linked to specific system requirements for traceability.

6. **Safety and Security Requirements**: Outlines additional requirements related to safety and security, ensuring that the platform can detect and respond to security incidents effectively.

7. **Roadmap**: Prioritizes the implementation of critical requirements based on hazard severity, focusing first on high-priority hazards like data integrity and user authentication before addressing secondary concerns.

8. **References**: Provides sources and standards used to guide the hazard analysis, including references to security best practices (e.g., OWASP guidelines, PCI-DSS compliance).
