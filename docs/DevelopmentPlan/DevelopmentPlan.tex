\section{Confidential Information?}

\wss{State whether your project has confidential information from industry, or
not.  If there is confidential information, point to the agreement you have in
place.}

\wss{For most teams this section will just state that there is no confidential
information to protect.}
\section{IP to Protect}

\wss{State whether there is IP to protect.  If there is, point to the agreement.
All students who are working on a project that requires an IP agreement are also
required to sign the ``Intellectual Property Guide Acknowledgement.''}

\section{Copyright License}

\wss{What copyright license is your team adopting.  Point to the license in your
repo.}

\section{Team Meeting Plan}
The team will meet weekly on Mondays from 11:30 until 13:20, in a study room booked by Kyle McMaster.
The schedule to meet with our supervisor will be determined when our supervisor is confirmed.\\\\
Weekly meetings will be chaired by Kyle, who will prepare an agenda to be sent in advance of team meetings. Team members can add additional agenda items as
needed. Team members are also able to request additional meetings if necessary. In this case, it is their responsibility to chair the meeting, 
organize a meeting location, and provide an agenda. Following all meetings, the meeting chair will prepare a list of action items.

\section{Team Communication Plan}

\wss{Issues on GitHub should be part of your communication plan.}

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Team Roles}
\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{All Team Members:} Every team member is responsible for developing code and creating tests for the code. Everyone is also responsible for reviewing open 
  pull requests and providing feedback if necessary. Additionally, all members will be tasked with creating issues using the appropriate templates, tracking issue status, 
  and updating issues assigned to them with relevant information. Each member is expected to attend meetings punctually and contribute ideas to discussions, while 
  maintaining respectful and concise communication. The role of meeting note taker will rotate among members in each meeting. The note taker should keep track of meeting attendance,
   issues discussed, decisions made, and action items. These notes should be well-maintained and easily accessible to all team members.
    \\ If we encounter challenges, we may consider switching roles to maintain progress and improve team performance. More specific roles can be assigned as the project evolves 
    and implementation details become clearer.
    \item \textbf{Mathew Petronilho:}
    Responsible for ensuring that all documents are formatted consistently, that all necessary components are included, and that there are no grammatical or spelling errors. 
    Also responsible for assisting team members with the front-end and taking the lead in implementing this component of the project.

    \item \textbf{Oleg Glotov:} Responsible for liaising with the supervisor, teaching assistant, and professor. 
    Coordinates project tasks among team members, organizes meetings, ensures equitable distribution of work, and monitors deadlines to ensure they are met.
    
    \item \textbf{Kyle McMaster:} Responsible for creating meeting agendas, guiding discussions, managing meeting time, and resolving conflicts. 
    Also responsible for assisting team members with the application's back-end logic, deploying services, and contributing expertise in machine learning and artificial intelligence 
    to integrate advanced data processing, and intelligent system functionalities.
    
    \item \textbf{Kartik Chaudhari:} Responsible for contacting potential customers and managing customer relationships. 
    Oversees the GitHub repository by organizing files and ensuring it is updated to reflect project progress. Provides guidance to team members on resolving issues related to Git.
    
\end{itemize}
\wss{You should identify the types of roles you anticipate, like notetaker,
leader, meeting chair, reviewer.  Assigning specific people to those roles is
not necessary at this stage.  In a student team the role of the individuals will
likely change throughout the year.}

\section{Workflow Plan}

\begin{itemize}
	\item How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?
	\item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
	classification, etc.?
  \item Use of CI/CD
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

% \begin{itemize}
%   \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
%   \item Include a link to your GitHub project
% \end{itemize}

We will use a Kanban board to track tasks for each deliverable. First, work to be completed will be identified and added to the project backlog.
Then, team members will be assigned tasks. Once assigned, they will be moved to the `Assigned' section of the board. When actively being worked on, they will
move to the `inflight' section. After completion, and when a pull request is made, they will be moved to the `for review' board. Finally, when the review is
complete, they are moved to the archive. This organization will allow us to track how different components of the project are progressing, and identify
if a team member is overwhelmed before it becomes a catastrophic issue.

The project can be found at \\\url{https://github.com/orgs/OKKM-insights/projects/1/settings}

% \wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
% details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
% for deadlines.}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Expected Technology}

% \wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
% libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
% the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
% libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
% learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

% \wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
% of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
% it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
% choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
% implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
% project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
% members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific libraries
\item Pre-trained models
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}

% \wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}

\section{Coding Standard}
Our back-end code, written in Python, will adhere to PEP 8 for code formatting and PEP 484 for type annotations. 
For our front-end code, written in JavaScript, we will follow the JavaScript Standard Style.
% \wss{What coding standard will you adopt?}
