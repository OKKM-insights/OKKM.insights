\subsection{Analysis}

Overall, the validation team is happy with the progress towards satisfying our refined functional requirements. Of the 13 attempted tests, nine were successful. Of the four which were unsuccessful,
only one failed due to some error related to implementation. The others are expected to fail, as they have yet to be implemented. The unexpected failure is `T-FR6', which has showed that large image files are unable to be uploaded to the 
project creation portal. The team has been able to trace this error back to our web hosting platform, and are in the process of identifying potential fixes. After this fix, and the implementation of report creation and satellite image requests, we will have demonstrated 100\% functional requirement validation.

    \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Analysis}
When conducting the validation of these requirements, we have identified a weakness of our current implementation. Of the seven attempted tests, only four passed. Of the ones that failed,
each one is due to a lack of focus from the development team. Now that there is a core structure in the application, we are able to begin addressing additional features, such as high performance data pipelines.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Analysis}
This application has been designed for security, and that is clear from the tests results. Six of the nine security tests pass, with partial passes for two of the failing tests. For the encryption test (T-SE7), user data is not yet encrypted, but passwords are. For the password validation test (T-SE4), 
all weak passwords are blocked, but some strong passwords are as well. The development team will address this issue in coming releases, but we are glad to know that if anything, we are not overly permissive. The requirement related to the remaining failed test (T-SE6), has been deemed `Medium' priority, and may be addressed in a future release.

\section{Changes Due to Testing}

\wss{This section should highlight how feedback from the users and from 
the supervisor (when one exists) shaped the final product.  In particular 
the feedback from the Rev 0 demo to the supervisor (or to potential users) 
should be highlighted.}

\subsection{Changes to Front-end}
Our labeling tool was largely refactored to incorporate the feedback we received from our usability testing. We also considered some of the unit testing outcomes. These changes included:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Added clearer visual feedback to all the buttons present in the labeling tool. Also made the currently selected label type more obvious to the user.
    \item Changed the contextual pop ups to include more detailed descriptions and any short cuts associated with a button.
    \item Added more details and made steps more granular in the help walk-through of the labeling tool. These additional details should help the user in further understanding what they need to do.
    \item Changed the text of the main submission buttons so that it was clear what would happen when they were pressed. For example, submit was renamed to "submit labels".
    \item Fixed a bug where the tool would get stuck if the submit button was pushed when there was no labels made.
    \item The label button now stays selected after a label is created so the user can seamlessly label multiple objects of the same class without having to reselect it every time.
    \item A visual gif will be added to show the basic process of creating a label so that it is clear the labels are to be drawn on the image.
    \item Rather than have tools spread out, they have all been condensed into an easy access toolbar.
    \item New button was added to reset zoom, contrast, brightness and image position back to its initial state.
    \item Removed white space.
    \item Removed help button when the project was complete.
\end{itemize}

\section{Automated Testing}
Automated testing and linting have been implemented in the frontend and backend repositories, as described in section 7.2 of the \href{https://github.com/OKKM-insights/OKKM.insights/blob/main/docs/DevelopmentPlan/DevelopmentPlan.pdf}{Development Plan}.

		
\section{Trace to Requirements}
The traceability from tests to requirements can be seen in section 4.3 of the \href{https://github.com/OKKM-insights/OKKM.insights/blob/main/docs/VnVPlan/VnVPlan.pdf}{VnV Plan}.
		
\section{Trace to Modules}
The traceability from requirements to modules can be seen in section 8 of the \href{https://github.com/OKKM-insights/OKKM.insights/blob/main/docs/Design/SoftArchitecture/MG.pdf}{Module Guide}. The tests that cover a specific requirement also cover the modules associated with that requirement.	

\section{Code Coverage Metrics}
\subsection{Front-end Coverage}
The coverage results of the front-end unit testing can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:FE_coverage}. Perfect coverage was not achieved, but we believe our unit tests supplemented with our manual and usability tests provide sufficient coverage of the code.
