# Verification and Validation Plan (V&V)

## Overview
This Verification and Validation (V&V) Plan is developed for the OKKM Insights project, aimed at verifying and validating that the platform’s functionalities and non-functional requirements meet the expectations and standards required by stakeholders. The V&V process ensures the system's reliability, usability, and performance, supporting the project's goals of providing accurate satellite image labeling for clients across various industries, including environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster response.

The V&V Plan is designed to:
- **Verify** that each component of the platform meets its specified requirements, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of core functionalities such as image labeling, data management, and user compensation.
- **Validate** that the platform meets the real-world needs of end-users, ensuring that the system is intuitive and accessible for data labelers, clients, and administrators.
- **Trace Requirements to Test Cases** to ensure comprehensive test coverage and to verify that all functional and non-functional requirements are addressed.

The V&V Plan serves as a roadmap for quality assurance throughout the development cycle, helping to identify and resolve issues before deployment.

## Folder Structure
The `vnv` folder contains the following files:

- **VnVPlan.pdf**: The complete Verification and Validation Plan in PDF format, detailing all V&V activities, including test strategies, test cases, and the traceability matrix. This document serves as a reference for the V&V process, ensuring that every requirement has corresponding tests.
  
- **VnVPlan.tex**: The LaTeX source file for the V&V Plan. This file is used to generate the PDF document and contains the structured content, sections, and formatting necessary to maintain consistency. Any updates to the V&V Plan should be made here.

## Key Sections in VnVPlan.pdf
The V&V Plan document is structured into several essential sections for the OKKM Insights project:

1. **General Information**: 
   - **Summary**: Provides an overview of the V&V plan specific to the OKKM Insights project.
   - **Objectives**: Outlines the primary goals of the V&V process, including ensuring data accuracy, system usability, and performance reliability.
   - **Challenge Level and Extras**: Highlights any particular challenges in validating the platform’s capabilities, such as the complexity of satellite image data and the diverse needs of stakeholders.
   - **Relevant Documentation**: References essential documents, including the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and the Development Plan.

2. **Plan**:
   - **Verification and Validation Team**: Lists the team members responsible for conducting V&V activities, with roles tailored to different aspects of the platform (e.g., data accuracy, user interface, and backend functionality).
   - **SRS Verification Plan**: Outlines procedures for verifying that all requirements in the SRS are met, including functional requirements for data labeling, user roles, and image management.
   - **Design Verification Plan**: Describes methods for verifying the platform’s architectural and module-level designs, ensuring alignment with the SRS requirements.
   - **Implementation Verification Plan**: Details the verification of individual components, such as the labeling module, payment processing, and data upload functionalities.
   - **Automated Testing and Verification Tools**: Lists any automated testing tools used, such as Selenium for UI testing or pytest for backend verification, to streamline the testing process.
   - **Software Validation Plan**: Defines the approach for validating the platform's usability and real-world effectiveness, ensuring it meets the needs of data labelers and clients in different sectors.

3. **System Tests**:
   - **Functional Requirements Tests**: Includes specific test cases for verifying core functionalities, such as user account management, image annotation, and data export.
   - **Non-functional Requirements Tests**: Lists test cases focused on performance, usability, and reliability, ensuring that the system can handle high volumes of data and concurrent users without compromising user experience.
   - **Traceability**: Provides a traceability matrix linking each test case to its respective requirement, ensuring that all functional and non-functional requirements are thoroughly tested.

4. **Unit Test Description**:
   - **Unit Testing Scope**: Specifies the focus of unit testing, primarily on isolated components like the image processing module, database access functions, and user role management.
   - **Tests for Functional Requirements**: Contains detailed unit tests for individual functionalities, such as the labeling tool’s annotation accuracy and the platform’s data retrieval processes.
   - **Tests for Non-functional Requirements**: Outlines unit tests for non-functional attributes, such as response time, error handling, and security in data transactions.
   - **Traceability**: Shows the relationship between test cases and the specific modules they verify, ensuring comprehensive coverage of both functional and non-functional aspects.
