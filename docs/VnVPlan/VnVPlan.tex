This document is intended to provide a description of the specific validation and verification activities that will be completed throughout the development of the Orbit Watch System.
The purpose of these activities is to ensure the system requirements agree with stakeholder needs, and to certify the implementation of the system satisfies the stakeholder requirements. This document will
start with a review of the system, a description of the testing plan, and a list of tests to be completed.


  \section{General Information}

  \subsection{Summary} \cite{Problem_Statement}
  
  Orbit Watch is an online platform developed by OKKM Insights to streamline and simplify satellite imagery data analysis. The software addresses the scarcity of high-quality, labeled satellite imagery datasets tailored for specific use cases across various industries such as disaster response, environmental monitoring, urban planning, and defense. Leveraging an AI-powered crowd-sourcing model, Orbit Watch enables users to label commercially available satellite images. These labeled datasets are then utilized to train custom computer vision models, enhancing accuracy and efficiency in image analysis. The platform offers a paid service for identifying objects within satellite images and distributes earnings to users who contribute to the labeling efforts.
  
  \subsection{Objectives} \cite{Problem_Statement}
  
  The primary objectives of the Verification and Validation (V\&V) plan for Orbit Watch are:
  
  \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Ensure High Data Accuracy}: Build confidence in the software's correctness by verifying that the system achieves high classification accuracy for objects reported in the images. This is crucial for extracting useful information and providing value to stakeholders.
      \item \textbf{Validate System Reliability and Accessibility}: Confirm that the system is reliable with minimal downtime and is accessible remotely for both purchasers and labelers, ensuring flexibility and efficiency in usage.
      \item \textbf{Ensure Data Confidentiality and Secure Access}: Implement robust authentication mechanisms and encryption protocols to protect sensitive satellite image data and user information, ensuring access is restricted to authorized users only.
  \end{itemize}
  
  The following objectives are out of scope for this V\&V plan:
  
  \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Verification of External Components}: We will not verify external libraries or services used for image acquisition, payment processing, or AI algorithms. It is assumed that these components have been adequately verified by their respective development teams.
      \item \textbf{Stretch Goals}: Objectives related to automatic data labeling and multi-source integration are considered stretch goals and will not be included in the current V\&V efforts due to time and resource constraints.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}\cite{Development_Plan} \cite{Problem_Statement}
  
  \, \, \, We aim to classify this project as an advanced level project. \\

  This project can be classified at the \textbf{advanced} challenge level due to several factors:
  
  \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Limited Domain Knowledge}: The team has minimal experience with satellite imagery and computer vision models, requiring additional research and learning to implement effective solutions.
      \item \textbf{Complex Implementation}: Developing a web application from scratch involves challenges in front-end development, integrating secure payment systems, handling parallel image labeling tasks, and designing consensus algorithms for data accuracy.
      \item \textbf{Integration of Multiple Components}: The project demands seamless integration of crowd-sourcing models, AI algorithms, payment processing, and user interfaces, increasing the complexity of development and testing.
  \end{itemize}
  

\textbf{Extras from the Problem Statement} \cite{Problem_Statement}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Usability Testing}: This phase involves selecting a group of users, ideally from the target demographic (e.g., professionals in satellite imagery analysis or end-users in agriculture or rescue services). These users interact with the application's interface, performing tasks relevant to the platform's purpose, like labeling images or reviewing AI-generated annotations. They then provide feedback via a structured questionnaire focusing on usability aspectsâ€”such as ease of use, intuitiveness, and clarity. This feedback helps refine the user interface to ensure it meets user expectations and requirements.

    \item \textbf{Demonstration Video}: The video will serve as an on-boarding tool, guiding users on how to navigate and utilize the platform effectively. It will highlight key features, demonstrate a labeling task from start to finish, and showcase any unique functionalities, such as model-assisted annotations or accuracy checks. The video can be used in training materials or as a quick tutorial accessible directly from the platform to help new users become familiar with the tool's workflow.

    \item \textbf{Formal Proof of Convergence for Labeled Images}: This proof aims to establish that labeled images converge toward a standard of accuracy and consistency. This involves statistical or mathematical validation showing that repeated labeling by different users (or with the assistance of AI) leads to a stable and reliable dataset over time. Proving convergence is crucial in ensuring that the labeling quality remains high, even as new users interact with the platform. This might include metrics such as inter-annotator agreement or AI confidence scores, contributing to the credibility and reliability of the labeled dataset.
\end{itemize}

% \wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
%   You should do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
%   for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

The SRS will be verified through several channels. First, the document will be reviewed by another capstone team. This will help the team identify issues
which are obscured to the team, due to the additional time they have spent thinking about the project. We expect this feedback to generally consist of 
omitted definitions or unstated assumptions. Since the team is more familiar with the project, it is likely that we have some information which is obvious 
to the team, but is necessary to define for others. The team will collect feedback from our primary reviewers in the issue tracker.\\
The SRS will also be reviewed by our supervisor in a structured review meeting. The team will guide the review with the following checklist:\\\\
\textbf{Constraints \& Assumptions}\\
The following sections are informed by the constraints \& assumptions. Therefore, it is critical that the these are verified first.
\begin{todolist}
\item All constraints are correct and necessary
\item All constraints are unambiguous
\item All constraints which should be present are present
\item All constraints are verifiable
\item All assumptions are correct and necessary
\item All assumptions are unambiguous
\item All assumptions which should be present are present
\item All assumptions are verifiable
\end{todolist}
\textbf{Data Model}\\
The data model affects how the system will be decomposed in the future design. This in turn affects the requirements, so it should be verified next.
\begin{todolist}
  \item Data model is correct
  \item Data model is complete
  \item Each element of data dictionary is correctly described. There are no extra or missing attributes.
  \item Elements of data dictionary are unambiguous
\end{todolist}
\textbf{Functional Requirements}\\
This section describes the functionality of the system. This will be useful for understanding the context of the NFRs.
\begin{todolist}
\item All requirements are correct and necessary
\item All requirements are unambiguous
\item All requirements which should be present are present
\item All requirements are verifiable
\item All requirements are feasible
\item All requirements are traceable
\end{todolist}
\textbf{Non-Functional Requirements}\\
The NFRs have now been properly introduced by the other sections and should now be assessed.
\begin{todolist}
  \item All requirements are correct and necessary
  \item All requirements are unambiguous
  \item All requirements which should be present are present
  \item All requirements are verifiable
  \item All requirements are feasible
  \item All requirements are traceable
  \end{todolist}
\textbf{General}\\
Each of the sections reviewed should also be monitored for the following criteria.
\begin{todolist}
  \item Document contains properly formatted title, table of contents, references and all necessary sections
  \item Tables and figures are correctly formatted
  \item No grammar errors are present
  \item Each required section is present
  \item All requirements are feasible
  \end{todolist}


% \wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may
%   include ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates (like your
%   primary reviewer), or you may plan for something more rigorous/systematic.}

% \wss{If you have a supervisor for the project, you shouldn't just say they will
% read over the SRS.  You should explain your structured approach to the review.
% Will you have a meeting?  What will you present?  What questions will you ask?
% Will you give them instructions for a task-based inspection?  Will you use your
% issue tracker?}

% \wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}
Upon completion of the System Design, the team will verify the design. This verification will involve reviews from the primary reviewers, in the same manner as described above.
This again will provide fresh prospective on the design, and help identify any omitted or under-explained information. The verification will continue with a systematic review with The
project supervisor using the following checklist:\\\\

\textbf{Class Decomposition}\\
\begin{todolist}
  \item All functional requirements are covered by some subset of classes/subsystems, that is no requirement is left uncovered
  \item All non-functional requirements are covered by some subset of classes/subsystems, that is no requirement is left uncovered
  \item All classes are correctly sized. That is, each class should be concerned with one purpose
  \item When appropriate, interfaces and abstract classes are used
  \item All class attributes are complete and necessary
  \item When appropriate, design patterns are used to improve design clarity
  \item Function permissions are appropriate for all classes
  \item Classes cannot be simplified without degrading the understandability of the system
  \end{todolist}
  \textbf{General}\\
\begin{todolist}
  \item The types of all attributes are listed
  \item The argument and return types of all functions are listed
  \item Correct notation is used to describe class relationships
  \item Class diagram is legible
  \end{todolist}
% \wss{Plans for design verification}

% \wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

% \wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}
This document must be verified and validated, to ensure the validation and verification of other artifacts is correct. Like other documents, this will include review
from our primary reviewers, as well as a review with the project supervisor. The review with the project supervisor will be guided by the following checklist:\\

\textbf{Testing Plan}\\
\begin{todolist}
  \item Testing plan includes a checklist for each artifact
  \item Checklist items are unambiguous
  \item Checklist contains all necessary items
  \item Checklist does not contain unnecessary items
  \item Plan includes review from multiple parties
  \item Plan includes method for collecting feedback on artifacts
  \item Plan is verifiable
  \end{todolist}
\textbf{Tests}\\
\begin{todolist}
  \item All functional requirements are covered by one or more tests\\
  \item All non-functional requirements are covered by one or more tests\\
  \item All `units' are sufficiently covered by one or more tests\\
  \item Tests are unambiguous
  \item Tests are verifiable
  \item Tests are repeatable
  \end{todolist}

% \wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be
% verified.  Techniques for this include review and mutation testing.}

% \wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

% \wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

As part of the implementation verification plan, the team will conduct a series of static tests. One of which, will be a code walk through with members of the team.
Before submitting Rev 0 and Rev 1, the members of the team will schedule time to walk through other members of the team through the code they have written. This will be 
an opportunity for the team to look for code quality and adherence to standards, correctness, and alignment to the system design. During this walk through, we expect that 
the lead developer of the code being displayed will explain the overall flow and control structures. In doing so, we expect they will find the errors in their own code.\\\\
The team will also use a suite of tests, which is described in section 4.\\\\
The team will used static analyzers to verify adherence to coding standards to perform type checking. Please refer to section 7.2.2 and 7.2.3 in the Development Plan found \href{https://github.com/OKKM-insights/OKKM.insights/blob/main/docs/DevelopmentPlan/DevelopmentPlan.pdf}{here}.

% \wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
%   testing plan.}

% \wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static
%   verification of the implementation.  Potential techniques include code
%   walkthroughs, code inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

% \wss{The final class presentation in CAS 741 could be used as a code
% walkthrough.  There is also a possibility of using the final presentation (in
% CAS741) for a partial usability survey.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

Please refer to section 7.2.2 and 7.2.3 in the Development Plan found \href{https://github.com/OKKM-insights/OKKM.insights/blob/main/docs/DevelopmentPlan/DevelopmentPlan.pdf}{here}.

% \wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
%   framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
%   include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
%   tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
%   Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
%   you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
%   that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
%   Python.}

% \wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
% that document.}

% \wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
%   implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}
  As discussed in section 6.2 of the Problem Statement and Goals, found \href{https://github.com/OKKM-insights/OKKM.insights/blob/main/docs/ProblemStatementAndGoals/ProblemStatement.pdf}{here}, 
  we will validate our software through user testing. More specifically, we will conduct testing of the user interface with peers, who will fill in a survey containing both qualitative and quantitative questions.
  This survey will be used to track progress on the usability of the software by comparing results collecting during different iterations of the user interface. See the appendix for a sample of the user survey.

% \wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
%   point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
%   here.}

% \wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
% the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
% inspection?}

% \wss{For those capstone teams with an external supervisor, the Rev 0 demo should 
% be used as an opportunity to validate the requirements.  You should plan on 
% demonstrating your project to your supervisor shortly after the scheduled Rev 0 demo.  
% The feedback from your supervisor will be very useful for improving your project.}

% \wss{For teams without an external supervisor, user testing can serve the same purpose 
% as a Rev 0 demo for the supervisor.}

% \wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}

\section{System Tests}

% \wss{There should be text between all headings, even if it is just a roadmap of
% the contents of the subsections.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

Please see unit test description found in section 6 of the \href{https://github.com/OKKM-insights/OKKM.insights/blob/main/docs/VnVReport/VnVReport.pdf}{VNVReport.}
% \wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
%   document) has been completed.}

% \wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
% philosophy for test case selection.}  

% \wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
% For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
% can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
% approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
% and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
% and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
% needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

% \subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

% % \wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
% %   developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
% %   verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
% %   have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
% %   explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

% \subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

% % \wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
% %   appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
% %   technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

% \subsubsection{Module 1}

% % \wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
% %   References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
% %   perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
% %   tests were selected.}



% \subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

% % \wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
% %   performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
% %   nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

% % \wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
% %   mentioned functional tests.}


% \subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Modules}

% \wss{Provide evidence that all of the modules have been considered.}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \\
    
    While working on this deliverable, we found that several things went particularly well for our team. From the very beginning, we laid out a clear plan and divided the tasks based on each person's strengths, which made the workload manageable and played to our individual skills. Getting an early start was a game-changer; it allowed us ample time to really delve into each aspect without feeling rushed. We also benefited from having some spare time due to lighter workloads in our other courses, which we used to do deeper research on each topic. Revisiting our SRS and applying it to our VnV plan challenged us to think critically and solidified our understanding of the project. Our communication was smooth throughout---we checked in regularly and supported each other whenever questions or issues came up. Overall, the combination of good planning, effective collaboration, and the extra time we invested made the process both successful and satisfying.
    
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
      did you resolve them?
      \\
  
      While working on this deliverable, we did face a few pain points that tested our teamwork and project management skills. One of the main challenges was investigating topics related to our project and tests that we hadn't openly discussed before; this led to some confusion and extra time spent getting everyone on the same page. Maintaining consistency across the entire document was also tricky---different writing styles and interpretations made parts of the doc feel uneven. We encountered build issues as well; some of us had to wait for others' pull requests to merge before we could proceed with our own work, which slowed down our progress. To tackle these problems, we discussed it during our meeting on Monday to openly discuss and clarify the unclear topics, ensuring everyone understood the direction we were heading. We also discussed that why working on documents is extremely important since it's worth a lot of our grade. Ensuring the deliverable met high standards despite any time pressures or setbacks is a key thing we discussed. By addressing these issues head-on, we were able to smooth out the rough patches and keep the project moving forward. \\
      \smallskip
      
      
    \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
    successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
    Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
    static testing knowledge, specific tool usage, Valgrind etc.  You should look to
    identify at least one item for each team member.\\
  
    To successfully verify and validate our project of processing high-definition satellite images for segmentation, our team needs to acquire a few specific skills. One team member plans to deepen his understanding of dynamic testing so he can effectively test his segmentation algorithms under various conditions. One of us will focus on static testing techniques, learning to use tools like Valgrind to identify and fix any code issues or inefficiencies. Another team member is going to get up to speed with image processing tools like OpenCV, which will be crucial for validating our segmentation results. The fourth member will work on performance profiling to ensure our application can handle large HD images smoothly without bogging down. We'll all need to become more familiar with handling and processing large satellite datasets, and possibly learn about machine learning model validation since we will be incorporating AI techniques for most part. By each of us focusing on these areas, we'll collectively cover all the bases needed for thorough verification and validation of our project.
  
  
    \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
    question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
    mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
    member pursue, and why did they make this choice?\\
  
    This is the potential list of what each team member might be doing (subject to changes):
  
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Kartik -- Dynamic Testing
      \item Mathew -- Static Testing
      \item Kyle -- OpenCV
      \item Oleg -- Performance Profiling
  \end{itemize}
  
  For dynamic testing, one of us considered enrolling in an online course or jumping straight into writing and running test cases on our code. We chose the hands-on route because some of us learn best by doing, and it lets us contribute directly to the project while improving our skills. The team member focusing on static testing and tools like Valgrind thought about attending a workshop or studying the documentation and applying it themselves. They decided to dive into the documentation and start using Valgrind on our code, preferring self-paced learning and immediate application. Our teammate working with OpenCV weighed taking a formal course versus following online tutorials and building small projects. They opted for the practical approach, believing that working on example projects would help them understand how to apply OpenCV to our needs more effectively. The fourth member, handling performance profiling, considered seeking guidance from a mentor or learning from online resources and applying them directly. They chose to start with online resources to quickly begin identifying and addressing performance issues in our application. Each of us picked the approach that aligns with our learning styles and allows us to make meaningful contributions to the project.
