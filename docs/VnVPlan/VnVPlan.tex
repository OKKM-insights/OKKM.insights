\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

  \section{2 General Information}

  \subsection{2.1 Summary}
  
  Orbit Watch is an online platform developed by OKKM Insights to streamline and simplify satellite imagery data analysis. The software addresses the scarcity of high-quality, labeled satellite imagery datasets tailored for specific use cases across various industries such as disaster response, environmental monitoring, urban planning, and defense. Leveraging an AI-powered crowd-sourcing model, Orbit Watch enables users to label commercially available satellite images. These labeled datasets are then utilized to train custom computer vision models, enhancing accuracy and efficiency in image analysis. The platform offers a paid service for identifying objects within satellite images and distributes earnings to users who contribute to the labeling efforts.
  
  \subsection{2.2 Objectives}
  
  The primary objectives of the Verification and Validation (V\&V) plan for Orbit Watch are:
  
  \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Ensure High Data Accuracy}: Build confidence in the software's correctness by verifying that the system achieves high classification accuracy for objects reported in the images. This is crucial for extracting useful information and providing value to stakeholders.
      \item \textbf{Validate System Reliability and Accessibility}: Confirm that the system is reliable with minimal downtime and is accessible remotely for both purchasers and labelers, ensuring flexibility and efficiency in usage.
  \end{itemize}
  
  The following objectives are out of scope for this V\&V plan:
  
  \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Usability Testing (Ease of Use)}: Due to limited resources, we will not conduct extensive usability testing to verify the ease of use of the platform. We assume that the user interface adheres to standard design principles that facilitate user interaction with minimal training.
      \item \textbf{Verification of External Components}: We will not verify external libraries or services used for image acquisition, payment processing, or AI algorithms. It is assumed that these components have been adequately verified by their respective development teams.
      \item \textbf{Stretch Goals}: Objectives related to automatic data labeling and multi-source integration are considered stretch goals and will not be included in the current V\&V efforts due to time and resource constraints.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \subsection{2.3 Challenge Level and Extras}
  
  This project is classified at the \textbf{advanced} challenge level due to several factors:
  
  \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Limited Domain Knowledge}: The team has minimal experience with satellite imagery and computer vision models, requiring additional research and learning to implement effective solutions.
      \item \textbf{Complex Implementation}: Developing a web application from scratch involves challenges in front-end development, integrating secure payment systems, handling parallel image labeling tasks, and designing consensus algorithms for data accuracy.
      \item \textbf{Integration of Multiple Components}: The project demands seamless integration of crowd-sourcing models, AI algorithms, payment processing, and user interfaces, increasing the complexity of development and testing.
  \end{itemize}
  
  No additional extras, such as formal proofs or GenderMag personas, are included in this project as per the agreed-upon problem statement.
  
  \subsection{2.4 Relevant Documentation}
  
  \textbf{--NOTE:-- Will add references to the SRS if the content is fine above --}
  
  \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Software Requirements Specification (SRS)}
      \item \textbf{Module Guide (MG)}
      \item \textbf{Module Interface Specification (MIS)}
      \item \textbf{User Documentation}
      \item \textbf{External Library and API Documentation}
  \end{itemize}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.  You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You should do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may
  include ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates (like your
  primary reviewer), or you may plan for something more rigorous/systematic.}

\wss{If you have a supervisor for the project, you shouldn't just say they will
read over the SRS.  You should explain your structured approach to the review.
Will you have a meeting?  What will you present?  What questions will you ask?
Will you give them instructions for a task-based inspection?  Will you use your
issue tracker?}

\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

\wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be
verified.  Techniques for this include review and mutation testing.}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static
  verification of the implementation.  Potential techniques include code
  walkthroughs, code inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\wss{The final class presentation in CAS 741 could be used as a code
walkthrough.  There is also a possibility of using the final presentation (in
CAS741) for a partial usability survey.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
that document.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
inspection?}

\wss{For those capstone teams with an external supervisor, the Rev 0 demo should 
be used as an opportunity to validate the requirements.  You should plan on 
demonstrating your project to your supervisor shortly after the scheduled Rev 0 demo.  
The feedback from your supervisor will be very useful for improving your project.}

\wss{For teams without an external supervisor, user testing can serve the same purpose 
as a Rev 0 demo for the supervisor.}

\wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}

\section{System Tests}

\wss{There should be text between all headings, even if it is just a roadmap of
the contents of the subsections.}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy.}

\wss{For some nonfunctional tests, you won't be setting a target threshold for
passing the test, but rather describing the experiment you will do to measure
the quality for different inputs.  For instance, you could measure speed versus
the problem size.  The output of the test isn't pass/fail, but rather a summary
table or graph.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\wss{If you introduce static tests in your plan, you need to provide details.
How will they be done?  In cases like code (or document) walkthroughs, who will
be involved? Be specific.}

  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}
